				<p>Valerie Harper has a message for women of a certain age: “Work those laugh lines!” With the irreverence and
					wit that made her one of television’s most beloved personalities, Harper (a.k.a. Rhoda Morgenstern) takes on
					those phony “fabulous at 50” books written by women whose skin is free of laugh lines and who wouldn’t know a
					cellulite pocket if it bit them on the backside. With her trademark shoot-from-the-hip,
					call-'em-like-she-sees-’em style, she helps women celebrate, with humor and grace, what it means to be middle
					aged.</p>

				<p>As Mary Richards's lovable and self-deprecating best friend Rhoda Morgenstern on The Mary Tyler Moore Show,
					Valerie Harper, too, turned the world on with her smile. Viewers could relate to Rhoda, native New Yorker and
					struggling working girl, who was unlucky in love and insecure about her weight but who always kept her sense
					of humor.
					Valerie was an unknown actress when she won the part that made her famous, and by the time Rhoda, her popular
					spin-off show, ended, she had won four Emmys and a Golden Globe. The role was groundbreaking.</p>
